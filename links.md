Perfect tool for absolute beginners.

6. [Recommended Coding Standard for C Programs](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab/cplus/cstyle.html)<br>
A simple document on recommended C programming style standards by AT&T's Indian Hill labs.
If you're new to C, this is an excellent page to get you acquainted with C programming conventions.
It will undoubtedly help your C code be more readable and maintainable.

7. [LearnCPP](https://www.learncpp.com/)<br>
C++ is a similar programming language to C, however both does have major differences. Most notably, C++ supports Object-Oriented Programming, while C does not. Still, I recommend this website to anyone learning C-style programming languages.

8. [Devhints](https://devhints.io/) -|- [Cheatography](https://cheatography.com/programming/) -|- [Quickref](https://quickref.me/) -|- [C Guide](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse351/14sp/sections/1/Cheatsheet-c.pdf)<br>
A compilation of programming cheatsheets made by different people, ranging from IDEs, programming languages, to programming frameworks, and more. Use it generously to get a quick reference or to remind yourself about the murky details.

9. [Openvim](https://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html)<br>
An interactive approach to learning vim, an improved version of vi. If you're still struggling at using vi as a text editor, this website will help you get a good grasp of it quickly.

10. [An Overview of Cryptography](https://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html)<br>
Immerse yourself in the world of cryptography. This article by Gary C. Kessler will introduce you to the field of cryptography, right from the very basic concepts to the algorithms people utilize for their security.

11. [Learnshell](https://www.learnshell.org/)<br>
Learn almost everything about the UNIX shell here. This website will teach you from the very basics until you're able to script for yourself. It should take you no time.

12. [IntroToC](https://eleceng.dit.ie/frank/IntroToC/)<br>
A nice small summmary of all the basics in C. It also has a handful of very useful diagrams that can help you understand the basic concepts. A great website if you need to get up to speed about C.

13. [Data Science at the Command Line](https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/2e/)<br>
This is an open-source ebook about using the command-line shell to process data. It describes detailed use cases for command-line tools such as grep, awk, sed, and more. There's also a lot of regex and scripting involved in the ebook. Furthermore, this ebook is currently still in development (as of writing this) and [you can be a part of it](https://github.com/jeroenjanssens/data-science-at-the-command-line). The book itself is scheduled to be published this month! (October 2021)

14. [Libretexts OS Course](https://eng.libretexts.org/Courses/Delta_College/Operating_System%3A_The_Basics) -|- [University of Illinois Chicago OS Course](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/)<br>
We are nearing the mid-point of this semester and perhaps you wanted to study more before the dreaded midterm exam. These here are a collection of different resources on operating systems that you should read aside from the Silberschatz book.

15. [Pointers and Memory](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/PointersAndMemory.pdf)<br>
Great document by Nick Parlante about pointers and memory management basics in C. It will provide you with a concrete understanding on how pointers and memory work in general. It also has links to other useful resources in it.

16. [Processes, Address Spaces, and Memory Management](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~aus/cs449/ts-lecture12.pdf)<br>
This is another brilliant learning material on memory management. It summarizes a lot you need to know about paging, memory allocation, address spaces, and virtual memory.

17. [Process Control](https://www.cs.uregina.ca/Links/class-info/330/Fork/fork.html#fork)<br>
Here is an impressive summary about system calls for process control like fork(), wait(), getpid(), etc. It shows what these system calls do on a UNIX-based shell and how to use them appropriately.

18. [Process Sync A](http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hamilton/courses/330/notes/synchro/synchro.html)<br>
This page covers the challenges of process synchronization, the two main solutions to critical section problems: Peterson's solution and Dijkstra's semaphore, and the conditions for a system deadlock to occur. In addition, it also shows algorithms that can prevent system deadlocks. This one is great to refer to from time to time.

19. [Process Sync B](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/5_Synchronization.html)<br>
This page is similar to the above, but it goes more in-depth about the three classical problems one would encounter in process synchronization, that is The Bounded-Buffer Problem, The Readers-Writers Problem, and The Dining-Philosophers Problem. It also covers in detail another technique to solving critical section problems: Monitors. This page is useful if you want to take a deeper look into actual examples in process synchronization.
